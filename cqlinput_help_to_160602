**   NAMELIST &setup0  SECTION
**
**   The namelist group "setup" occurs in the cqlinput file twice.
**   [Now deprecated: works, but use &setup0.  See below BH070414.]
**   The first instance of the "setup" [now setup0] section of the
**   cqlinput namelist file contains the following variables (which
**   should not be repeated in the second instance of "setup"):
**
**   mnemonic, ioutput, iuser, ibox, noplots,lnwidth,nmlstout,
**   special_calls,cqlpmod,lrz,lrzdiff,lrzmax,lrindx,
**   ls,lsmax,lsdiff,lsindx,nlwritf,nlrestrt,

**   BH070414:  Above use of "setup" as a "first setup namelist"
**              is depracated.   PLACE above variables in 
**              separated namelist &setup0.
**              [Modification for SWIM Integrated Plasma Simulator.]
**
**   Descriptions follow immediately below.
**
*************************************************************
** 
**  mnemonic is the run designator...to help keep track of runs. 
**    for example: mnemonic="wy01"
**    mnemonic is dimensioned a48, 
**                       i.e., ok for up to 48 characters.
**    Used as prefix to output PS and netCDF files.
**    default: mnemonic="mnemonic"
**
**  ioutput determines graphical o/p (PS only at moment, so no effect.)
**
**  iuser ="name" of user or "number" of user (no present use).
**
**  ibox="box ***" where *** is user's box number (no present use).
**
**  Parameters are set in param.h giving maximum dimensions
**    of variables used in the code.  The code may be run
**    with dimensions which are less than the input parameters,
**    as specified below by namelist variables lrz, lrzmax,
**    ls, lsmax, (and others,) as specified below.
**
**    The parameter machinea specifies the size of integer words:
**       (=1, for 8 byte integers, =2, for 4 byte integers).
**
**  lrz is the number of radial flux surfaces in the computational
**    grid on which Fokker-Planck equation is solved.
**
**  lrzdiff="enabled", compute distribution functions on subset
**    of the flux surfaces considered. 
**    This system was setup to reduce computational time, when
**    only interested in few of the FP surfaces, but want to specify
**    the radial profile of background species on a more refined lrzmax
**    grid.  (default="disabled")
**
**  lrzmax is number of flux surfaces, including any not FP'd.
**    lrzmax=1, then this gives single flux surface runs with no input
**           of profiles
**    lrzmax.ge.4 uses input profiles of density, etc.
**    (lrzmax=2,3 to be avoided, and problems with some cubic splines.)
**    lrzmax is set =lrz, if lrzdiff.ne."enabled"
**
**  lrindx(1:lrz)=indices of flux surfaces where the FP'ing is
**    performed.
**    (if lrz=lrzmax, i.e., all flux surfaces are to be FP'ed, 
**    then it is unnecessary to specify lrzmax, lrindx, and lrzdiff).
**  
**  noplots="enabled1" inhibits all plots.
**    default: noplots="disabled" 
**    [="enabled" inhibits old unimplemented graflib plots, and was
**     necessary for code to run, but now all old graflib replaced.
**     so it should have same effect as "disabled", BH and YuP, 120122]
**    noplots="enabled1"  can be useful to load the code without 
**    a pgplot library.
**    The -Wl,-noinhibit-exec gnu loader (ld) option exists in gfortran
**    which enables loading of the code in the presence of unsatisfied
**    externals.  With noplots='enabled', the references to pgplot
**    routines in the code will be avoided.  Similar options exist
**    for several other compiler groups.
**
**  lnwidth=line-width attribute for plotting; affects lines, graph
**          markers, and text.  Specified in units of 0.005 in, and
**          must be an integer.  [default=3]
**          [Smaller value may work better for vector plots.]
**          Conversion from .ps to .pdf using ps2pdf improves the plot.
**
**
**  nmlstout="enabled", prints namelists to stdout
**           "trnscrib", transcribes the cqlinput nml file to stdout
**            else,   suppress this output.
**            default:  nmlstout="trnscrib"
**
**  special_calls="enabled", then code makes system calls to find
**                name of system and pwd, for output.   This is not
**                allowed on some systems.
**               ="external", then files uname_output and pwd_output
**                are used to printout.  These many be created with
**                and external script containing
**                uname -a > uname_output
**                pwd > pwd_output
**               ="disabled", then no system calls and not reference
**                to uname_output and pwd_output files.
**                This gets around lack of some special functions,
*                 e.g., second(), with some compilers.
**
**  nlwritf="enabled"  saves the distribution function at the end of 
**               the run (in file distrfunc).   default="disabled"
**         ="ncdfdist", don't write distn function into text file
**               distrfunc, since can use mnemonic.nc save of f.
**               Text distrfunc will contain only namelist and profiles
**               at the end of the run.
**  nlrestrt="enabled" reads the initial distribution function in 
**               text file 'distrfunc'.           default="disabled"
**          ="ncdfdist" reads the distribution function from a
**               netcdf file, 'distrfunc.nc'.  This file can be
**               the mnemonic.nc file from a previous run.
**               The text file 'distrfunc' is still needed, but only for
**               reading namelist from &setup and others (except %setup0),
**               ensuring compatibility of grids, etc.  (Can change
**               mnemonic in &setup0.)
**               Reading of distrfunc for nlrestrt='ncdfdist' or
**               'ncregrid' discontinued (BH110201).
**          ='ncregrid', same as 'ncdfdist', except the momentum-per-
**               mass grid can be reset from that used in distrfunc.nc,
**               by changing enorm, jx and xfac (only enabled changes
**               presently, not iy or lrz) in cqlinput.  If enorm/vnorm
**               is increased, the distrn for distrfunc.nc is extrapolated
**               linearly in ln(f) versus v(mom-per-mass).  Portions of the 
**               distn fnctn in distrfunc.nc within the bounds of the
**               new x() grid specified by the namelist input are 
**               interpolated onto the new grid. The FSA density of the
**               new code distribution is maintained equal to the
**               restart distribution function in the .nc file.
**               enorm/vnorm can be either increased or decreased from
**               the value in the distrfunc.nc file.
**               Reading of distrfunc text file for nlrestrt='ncdfdist' or

**************************************************************
**
**   MAJOR TIME STEP CONTROLS
**   (The following variables down to the "sousetup" namelist
**     description , are in "setup" namelist.)
**
*************************************************************
**
**  dtr is the time step in seconds. 
**    (n is time step counter.  Initially n=0.  It is incremented after
**     each step).
**    dtr can be nonphysically large for implicit steady state
**    calculations, with transp="disabled": 
**    dtr= 1. --> 10. is a typical choice if implct="enabled".
**    This allows code to "jump" to steady state (for linear problems).
**    transp="enabled"/soln_method='direct' cases will require dtr 
**    values less than or  of order the collision time of the nonthermal
**     particles, to get accurate results, to prevent oscillations
**     between the velocity and radial space solutions.
**    default: dtr=5.
**
**  dtr1(1:10) is array of  additional time step settings 
**    (can be shorter or longer than dtr) starting
**    at time step nondtr1(1:10), if nondtr1().gt.-1. (default: dtr1()=0.0)
**
**  nondtr1(1:10) is array of steps at which the corresponding new
**    time step dtr1(1:10) starts.
**    Choose mod(nondtr1().gt.0,nrstrt)=0, else it is reset to next
**    highest value.  (default: nondtr1(1:10)=-1).
**
**  nstop is the number of time steps (or cycles) to be run.
**    default: nstop=5
**
**  nrstrt is the number of cycles to advance on a flux
**    surface before moving on to the next flux surface.
**    Operant only if lrz > 1
**    default: nrstrt=1
**    BH100517:  Defunct functionality.  Only possibility is
**               default case, nrstrt=1.
**
**  nplot(1:nplota) gives time steps for plotting of data for
**    individual flux surfaces. 
**    default: nplot(1:nplota)=0
**
**  iactst="enabled" means certain debugging diagnostics are called:
**     subroutines diagimpd, exsweepx, and exsweept are utilized.
**     This option should be used only in debugging mode. 
**     iactst="abort" means abort the code if the computed 
**     error is .gt. 1.e-8 (relative difference between integrated
**     rhs and lhs of difference equation).
**     default: "disabled"
**
**************************************************************
**
**  MESH CONTROLS
**
**************************************************************
**
**  jx is the number speed mesh points. 
**    Speed also means momentum/rest mass for relativistic calcs.
**    default: jx=300  (in aindflt.f).
**    The basic speed mesh runs from 0. to xmax=1.0.
**
**  iy is the number of theta mesh points. Must be even number.
**    default: iy=200  (in aindflt.f).
**    The y (theta) mesh is symmetric about pi/2.
**    For urfmod="enabled", iy.gt.255 not allowed with 
**      the storage scheme for ilim1,ilim2,....[BH070418: relaxed now?]
**    (Have had difficulty constructing a mesh iy as small as 30, 
**     and meshy.eq."fixed_y".)
**    The positive theta dirn (i.e., v_parallel) has positive component
**       in the positive toroidal direction (counter-clockwise, looking
**       from the top).
**
**  lz is the number of poloidal (or field line mesh points). Bounce-
**    averages are computed over this mesh. lz must be .le. lza
**    (a parameter).
**    default: lz=lza (lza is a parameter)
**
**  vnorm is the velocity normalization constant (cm/sec).
**    For relativistic calculations, vnorm is the maximum momentum/unit
**    rest mass on the mesh.
**    default: vnorm is set through enorm (below).
**
**  enorm is the energy corresponding to the velocity normalization
**    constant; if kenorm corresponds to a species index, that
**    species determines vnorm through enorm, superseding vnorm. (kev)
**    default: enorm=200., kenorm=1
**
**  tandem="enabled" facilitates the use of both ions and electrons
**    as general species. The mesh extends to a speed (momentum)
**    represented by an electron energy of enorme. However, the
**    majority of the mesh points are dedicated to a region of
**    velocity space which adequately represents ions with a
**    energy less than enormi. The ion species selected for this
**    treatment is the first general ion species listed. Most
**    of the plots are fixed so that the ion contributions are visible
**    and not squeezed into the first 1% of the plot.
**    tandem="disabled" disengages this option.
**    default: tandem="disabled"
**
**  enorme,enormi are analogues to enorm for tandem="enabled"
**    enorme corresponds to the top of the electron mesh,
**    enormi corresponds to the top of the ion mesh.
**    [defaults: enorme=enorm, enormi=enorm]
**
**  relativ="enabled" means the quasi-relativistic calculation and
**    mesh are activated.  Best for fusion plasmas.
**         ="fully" give fully relativistic calc.   Has some limitations
**           in maximum order Legendre polynomial to be used in
**           expansion for FP coefficients (mx, below, .le.3, or so).
**           See CompX report CompX-2009-1_Fully-Rel.pdf.
**    default: relativ="enabled"
**
**  xfac is the velocity mesh spacing parameter.
**    xfac=1. ==> uniform mesh;
**    xfac<1. ==> geometric mesh with greater mesh resolution at x=0;
**    xfac>1. ==> greater resolution at xmax.
**    xfac<0. ==> xpctlwr,xpctmdl,xlwr,xmdl must be input.
**    xfac<0. ==> the momentum (velocity) mesh contains three regions:
**    The region [0,xlwr] will have jx*xpctlwr evenly spaced 
**    mesh points.
**    The region [xlwr,xmdl] will have xpctmdl*jx mesh points.
**    The region [xmdl,xmax] will have the balance of the jx 
**    mesh points.
**    default: xfac=1.
**    (xfac,xpctlwr,xlwr,xpctmdl,xmdl are reset appropriately, if 
**     tandem="enabled").
**
**  tfac is the theta mesh spacing parameter.
**    tfac=1 ==> uniform mesh except in the vicinity of the
**      pass/trapped boundary region. See tbnd below.
**    tfac<1. ==> geometric mesh with points packed closer at p/t bndry.
**    tfac>1. ==> geometric mesh with points packed closer 0., pi, 
**    and pi/2.
**    default: tfac=1.
**  tfac=-1.  ==>Appropriate for radial transport, transp="enabled"
**    calculations.   This will give uniform theta mesh at each 
**    radius.   There will be slight adjustments near t-p bndry
**    at each radius, but no addition of extra points bounding the
**    trapped-passing boundary, as for tfac.gt.0. case.
**    If tfac.gt.0. and transp="enabled" and soln_method.ne."direct"
**    then tfac is reset to -1. at beginning of run.
**    
**    If tfac negative and .ne.-1, then mesh adjusted according to 
**    positive tfac above, with abs(tfac) values.  No added pts near t-p.
**  There is also a tfac.lt.0./cqlpmod="enabled" option (see below).
**
**  yreset="enabled" means pack extra theta mesh points in some
**    specified (below) region.
**    default:yreset="disabled"
**    [Not working at present, and if "enabled" will be reset to
**     "disabled" in ainsetva.f, for lrz>1.] 
**
**  numby is the number of packed theta mesh points
**    numby should be significantly less than iy/2 (or resolution
**    will be to coarse in the rest of pitch angle space).
**    Recall that the y (theta) mesh is symmetric about pi/2.
**    Only used if yreset="enabled".
**    default: numby=20
**
**  ylower and yupper specify the radian spread of the packed region
**    below pi/2. Avoid allowing [ylower,yupper] to include the p/t
**    boundary region [y(itl-1),y(itl+1)].
**    This option is automatically disabled if lrz > 1.
**    Only used if yreset="enabled".
**
**  tfacz is the field line coordinate (z) mesh spacing parameter.
**    default: tfacz=1.
**    tfacz is not operational for eqsym="none", in which case the z-mesh
**    is uniform on either side of the max-|B| point on the flux surface.
**
**  tbnd(1:lrorsa) is the width (in radians) of the passing/trapped boundary 
**    layer. There is usually no reason to change the default value.
**    If necessary the program may reset this value at some
**    flux surfaces.
**    default: tbnd=.002, tbnd(2:lrorsa)=0.
**
**  rfacz is the radial mesh spacing parameter. The minimum value of
**    the mesh can be pre-specified (see roveram below). Otherwise
**    rfacz works like xfac for xfac > 0.
**    default:rfacz=.7
**
**  roveram determines the value of r/radmin = rya(1) by setting
**    rya(1)=roveram.   It works in conjunction with
**    rfacz above. If roveram < 1.e-8, the minimum flux surface is
**    determined internally with no user control. This option is
**    useful for keeping the innermost flux surface away from the
**    magnetic axis.
**    default: roveram=1.e-8
**
**  rzset="enabled" allows the user to specify the entire radial
**    rya mesh as an array of values r(l)/radmin where r(l) is the
**    radial coordinate and radmin in this case takes on
**    the meaning of the radial coodinate at the LCFS.
**    ="disabled", mesh follows rfacz directive, above.
**    default: rzset="disabled"
**
**  rya(l),l=1,lrzmax is the normalized radial mesh referred to above in
**    the rzset description. The user specifies rya(1)=.02, rya(2)=.05,...
**    rya(23)=.95, for instance, if lrzmax=23
**    Thus rya(l)=r(l)/radmin, and rya is a code array.
**    (Note: rya is dimensioned rya(0:lrza+1), so need to specify
**    first namelist input value explicitly as rya(1)=....).
**
**  radcoord="sqtorflx" (default) use normalized radial coordinate (that is,
**           flux surface label) proportional to sqrt of toroidal flux.
**           [Presently, radial diffusion eqn is only set up for this value
**            of radcoord.  Additional choices below are for no radial 
**            transport.]
**          ="sqarea" square root of flux surface area,
**          ="sqvolume" square root of flux surface volume,
**          ="rminmax" 0.5*(max. major radius - 
**                          min. major radius) of flux surface
**          "polflx"  normalized poloidal flux from magnetic
**                    axis to last closed flux surface (LCFS).
**          "sqpolflx"  normalized square root of poloidal flux function.

**
**  DIFFERENCING and SOLUTION METHOD CONTROLS
**
*************************************************************
**
**  chang= "enabled" forces Chang Cooper differencing; = "disabled" forces
**    standard centered differencing. chang="noneg" employs an additional
**    scheme to minimize resulting negative distributions in strongly
**    driven RF fields. Actually, we employ a variant of strict Chang-
**    Cooper differencing.  Typical Chang-
**    Cooper looks at dx*A/B where A is the advective coefficient and
**    B the diffusive. The closer the ratio is to zero, the closer the
**    differencing is to central. As the ratio grows larger in absolute
**    value, the differencing shifts to upwind. We have
**    empirically determined that in the presence of strong RF excitation
**    that even with the use of Chang-Cooper, the distribution can
**    be driven negative. This may be due to a 2-D effect, since the
**    RF diffusion characteristics rarely coincide with the theta and v
**    mesh directions. It was discovered that by subtracting off the
**    contribution from the RF diffusion from the total diffusion
**    coefficient and then computing the ratio above, the scheme is
**    driven in the upwind direction and the problem is vastly
**    ameliorated, in most cases, the difficulties disappear. The
**    ratio is now dx*A*B/(B-B_ql)**2 for the
**    velocity differencing. In the limit B_ql==>0, we recover
**    Chang-Cooper. For the theta differencing, the approach
**    is similar, except that if chang="noneg", strict one sided
**    differencing is enforced in the regions where the distribution has been
**    previously driven negative (during earlier time-steps). All
**    of this manipulation is a result of experimentation and
**    has not been proven to be useful rigorously....as indeed
**    neither has Chang Cooper for the 2D problem.
**    default: chang="enabled"
**
**  ineg="enabled" means negative values of the distribution function 
**    are reset to zero after time advancement; ="disabled" 
**    defeats this option.  But, see update below 03-2011 comment.
**    default: ineg="enabled"
**   ="renorm" means if f developes negative values after a time
**    step, then add 1.1*abs(min(f)) to f, and then multiply by
**    (old_line_density/new_line_density), to keep total number
**    of particles constant during this renormalization.  This option
**    is an attempt to deal with negative distributions sometimes
**    occurring with QL diffusion.  It can add unacceptable amounts of
**    high energy particles to the distribution. (BobH, sept/94)
**   ="trunc_d" is another attempt to cope with QL diffusion causing
**    negative distributions:  the QL diffusion coefficients are 
**    smoothly reduced to zero over the last 10 velocity grid points. 
**    Also, negative values of f reset to zero.
**    
**    Modification made after [03-2011] to ineg="enabled" or "trunc_d": 
**    (See diagimpd.f)
**    If distr.function f(i,j) is negative or zero 
**    at some (i,j)-point in vel. space,
**    it is set to zero for ALL jj.ge.j 
**    (and fixed i-index of pitch angle),
**    for energies greater than the maximum in the source term
**    (for example from NBI).  For lower energies, neg f is set = 0.
**    Before this modification, it was set to zero 
**    for only this specific (i,j)-point where f(i,j)<0.
**    So, no more "islands" in distribution function

**
**  implct= "enabled" forces implicit differencing and
**    Gaussian elimination. implct  = "disabled" forces operator 
**    splitting (can be used for time dependent calculations).
**    The implct namelist variable relates to (only) the velocity-space
**    differencing of the FP eqn, and method of solution.
**    implct="enabled", uses LAPACK linear algebra subroutines which have

**    default: implct="enabled"
**
**  manymat="enabled" allows all the factored matrices on all flux
**    surfaces to live on disk and not disappear after the backsolve.
**    This means that the next time step will NOT require a new 
**    factorization IF THE RHS HAS NOT CHANGED. This saves lots
**    of computer time and is the recommend operating mode. 
**    manymat="disabled" does not save the factored matrices on disk
**    and is useful for single flux surface calculations where the

**  lbdry(k)="conserv" means conservation boundary conditions used

**    Zero v-flux at v=0 is enforced in this case.
**    Also, no resetting of plasma density.
**  lbdry(k)="fixed" means zero flux boundary conditions are not 
**    enforced at v=0. Instead the distribution is held constant at 
**    v=0 during "time" advancement.  Also, if elecfld is set through 
**    eoved, then f(v=0) is only set at time step n=0, and not reset.
**    Unicity at v=0 is applied.
**  lbdry(k)="scale" is like "fixed", but after the solution for
**    the distribution, f, is found, the entire distribution is scaled
**    so that the resulting field line integrated number density does
**    not change in "time". Unicity at v=0 is applied.

**  NOTE:  no "enabled" or "disabled" option for lbdry().
**
**  Following lbdry0 input only applies for implct="enabled":
**  lbdry0="enabled" means use new system computing distrn function f
**    at v=0 that takes f to be a single value.  This uses 
**    subroutine impavnc0 for implicit time advancement.  (Modifications
**    originated by Olivier Sauter). (default="enabled", implct="enabled").
**    This option only applied if lbdry(i)="conserv" or "conserv_scale".
**  lbdry0=.ne."enabled" means use old system which computed non-unique
**    f(v=0) and then set f(v=0) to density conserving average.  Uses
**    subroutine impavnc. (Applies for implct="enabled").
**
**  taunew="enabled" means use new fully numerical calculation of dtau
**          and tau times (BobH, 970210).
**          Although more accurate, there remains some work to ensure
**          compatibility of the extended theta_poloidal region of

**    machine="mirror" is disabled for lrz .gt. 1
**    default: machine="toroidal"
**
**  psimodel determines the model used (or the method used) to determine

**  psimodel="smith" means Gary Smith's model is used for mirror problems.

***********************************************************
**
**  SPECIES DESCRIPTORS
**
**************************************************************
**
**  In the following, the index (k) refers to the species being
**    assigned the particular value.  The following conventions are
**    assumed:
**
**    If 1 .le. k .le. ngen, then k is a general (time-advanced) species.
**    k.gt.ngen means species k is background Maxwellian.
**    General species are represented by f(theta,x,k,l_), a distribution
**    function which evolves in time, whereas the background Maxwellians
**    are represented by two quantities, temp(k,) and reden(k,).
**    In k order, the general (non-Maxwellian time advanced species) 
**    come before the background species. Electrons and
**    ions can be mixed, and any species can be represented
**    simultaneously as a general and a background species.
**    If there is more than one Maxwellian ion, then they must
**    not be separated in k by the electron species.   If more than
**    one of the ion species has the same charge number bnumb(), (e.g.,
**    H+, D+, and/or T+) then they should be placed successively at the
**    beginning of the Maxwellian ion species.
**
**********************************************************************
**
**  ngen is the number of general species. It must not exceed
**    parameter value ngena or code will abort with error message.
**    default:ngen=ngena
**
**  nmax is the number of Maxwellian species. It must not exceed
**    parameter nmaxa or the code will abort with an error message.
**    default: nmax=nmaxa
**
**  kspeci(1,k) is the name of species(k) for k=1,ntotal(=nmax+ngen).
**  kspeci(2,k) is "general" or "maxwell" for k=1,ntotal, 
**    designate species as general of Maxwellian.	
**
**  fmass(k) is the mass(k) in grams.
**    default: fmass(k)=1.e-29
**    Ions are defined by having mass .gt.1.e-27.
**
**  bnumb(k) is the atomic number  (-1. for electrons)
**    default: bnumb(k)=1.
**
**  iprote, iproti and iprone, are flags with several possible values
**     (below) governing the electron temperature, ion temperature
**     and densities of the plasma profiles for the species.
**     We have the following possibilities:
**  iprote="parabola","spline", "asdex" "prbola-t", and "spline-t"
**     (similarly for iproti and iprone).
**     Each option is described below.
**     (The "-t" are time-dependent, and are descibed in a separate
**     TIME-DEPENDENT PROFILES section below.)
**     default: "parabola" for everything
**  iprozeff, iproelec, iprovphi, ipronn:  See below.
**
**  iprote or iproti or iprone = "parabola"      
**    npwr(k) and mpwr(k) (real) specify the profiles: 
**     The  form is (center-edge)*(1-(r/a)**npwr)**mpwr+edge between the
**     specified center and edge values described below (see subr profaxis).
**  npwr(0) and mpwr(0) give reden profiles whereas npwr(k) and
**     mpwr(k) give the temp profiles for species k. npwr and mpwr
**     are real variables, not integers.
**     default: npwr(0)=2.; npwr(k)=2. for all (k=1:ngen+nmax) (k=1:ntotal).
**     default: mpwr(0)=1.; mpwr(k)=3. for all k>0.
**
**  reden(k,l) is the initial density at the midplane (particles/cm**3).
**     FOR lrz.gt.1 (and iprone.eq."parabola"): 
**     The user specifies reden(k,0) (central value) and reden(k,1)
**     (edge value). The intermediate values (l=1,lrzmax) are computed 
**     by the code (see below).  
**     FOR lrz.eq.1:
**     The user specifies reden(k,1)
**     This rule (involving lrz) is used throughout input. See temp
**     and eparc and eperc for example. 
**     default: reden(k,l))=1. (for l=1,lrzmax)
**
**  temp(k,l) is the initial temperature (Kev) of species k. This
**    applies both to general and background species. See reden above
**    for specification rule.
**    default: temp(k,l)=1.
**
**  profpsi="disabled" means that the density and temperature profiles
**    will obey the npwr and mpwr directives (above).
**  profpsi="enabled" means that the profiles have the following
**    dependence (used in early days of the code):
**    reden(k,l)=reden(k,0)*((psi(l)-psimag)/psimag)**.5
**    temp(k,l)=temp(k,0)*(psi(l)-psimag)/psimag
**    default: profpsi="disabled"
**
**  iprote, iproti, iprone, iprozeff, iproelec, iprovphi, ipronn = "spline"  
**      In this case the user can specify namelist variable
**      arrays which give radial profile information for cubic splines. 
**      A spline routine will interpolate the ene, te, and/or ti data 
**      onto the computational mesh.
**      For specified profiles of ene, te, and/or ti, we have:
**      (l=1:100,k=1,ntotala=ngena+nmaxa)
**      See iprozeff below.
**    ryain(l)  (r/a)  l=1,njene (the radial coordinate)
**    enein(l,k)  the specified density of species k at ryain(l) (/cm**3)
**      (if enein(1,k)=0. for species k.gt.1, then the enein(l,k-1)/bnumb(k)
**       values will be used for species k). 
**    tein(l)   the specified electron temperature (keV)
**    tiin(l)   the specified ion temperature (same for all ion species
**                       such that bnumb(k).ne.-1.) (keV)
**    enescal, tescal, tiscal (and zeffscal, elecscal, see below)  
**    are scale factors for "spline" input.
**       (defaults = 1.0).
**    20100126:  Also added that enescal,tescal,tiscal multiply
**               all input density/temperature profiles.
**               Can be useful, e.g., when units need adjusting.
**               elecscal multiplies t-dep input for efswtch.eq."method1".
** 
**    njene must be less than njenea (= 256 is typ value) 
**       default:  0 
**
**   (There are also namelist input variables njte, njti (but no
**    njzeff) similar to ONETWO input, but for now these variables
**    have no effect, since the spline values of te, ti, zeff
**    are all assumed to be input on the same ryain(1:njene) mesh.)
**
**  iprote(or ti) (or ne) = "asdex"      
**      In this case, the code has ASDEX-type exponential profiles
**      hard-wired into the code. The user need not make further
**      specifications. See subroutines tdxinitl and tdpro.
**      Uses acoefne,acoefte.  
**      default: none
**
**  iprozeff = "disabled" (default), "parabola", or "spline":
**           
**           = "disabled", then this option has no effect.
**           = "parabola","prbola-t", "spline"  or "spline-1", then this 
**             option gives ion densities so as to achieve a given zeff
**             radial profile, consistent with charge neutrality and the 
**             given electron density profile.
**
**             There must be at least one Maxwellian ion species
**             for this case.
**             If there are more than one Maxwl ion species with
**             bnumb() the same as the first (e.g., H+, D+, and/or T+),
**             then these will be treated as a unit, and their densities
**             adjusted proportionately, as required.
**             It is necessary to specify these equal-bnumb() species
**             successively at the beginning of the Maxwl ion species,
**             and the densities reden(,) should contain the relative
**             ratios of each species: e.g., reden(k,)=0.99,
**                reden(k+1,)=0.01 gives 99% 1st species.
**             Only up to two different Z ions are implemented for this
**             option.
**             If there are two different bnumb() Maxwellian ion species
**             specified, then densities of these species are adjusted 
**             to obtain the zeff-profile.
**             If only one bnumb() value (for .ge.1 Maxwl ions) is 
**             specified, then bnumb,fmass are as input above into
**             namelist, and an additional ion species is automatically
**             added with  bnumb=50., fmass=50*2.*1.67e-24.
**             The densities of the two different bnumb() species will
**             be adjusted to achieve the specified profile of zeff.
**             The first general ion species (if it exists)
**             will be given density of the first of the two Maxwellian
**             species.
**             The second general ion species (if it exists) will be given
**             the density of the second Maxwellian ion species.
**             Etc.
**             (remember that an added species will have bnumb=50,
**             fmass=50*2.*1.676e-24.)
**             In particular,
**             = "parabola", then input zeff profile by
**               zeffin(0)=central value, zeffin(1)=edge value,
**               npwrzeff,mpwrzeff (real numbers) specify parabolic
**               profile as is done above for reden.
**             = "spline", then input zeff profile data in 
**               zeffin(1:njene), as done above for enein.
**               ***NB***  MUST explicitly put zeffin(1)=,in this case.
**             If using time-dependent profiles, then need
**             iprozeff="parabola", and input profiles as specified
**             below.  iprozeff="spline" is not presently implemented
**             for time-dep. case.

**  fpld(1:6,1:ngena) controls "additional" loading of the of the
**      equatorial distribution functions, at time step nfpld.
**      This set of options was instituted for purposes of study of the
**      electron knock-on runaway problem. 
**        It can also be used for INITIALIZING the 
**      Fokker-Planck'd distribution (ngen=1)
**      from externally generated distributions (see, for example,
**      the IDL procedure make_input_distn.pro, BobH, 001124).
**        (The default, fpld(1,1:ngena)=0.0,
**      gives no  loading of distribution functions beyond initial
**      (relativistic) Maxwellians derived from the specified density, 
**      temp. and zeff.)  
**        The additional loading 
**      is in the form of a internally generated vel-space-constant
**      plus a shifted "Maxwellian" distribution which is localized in
**      pitch angle, or,  distributions read in from file "fpld_dsk".
**      (See subroutine finit.)
**      fpld(1,1)= -1.0,  (Previously "fpld_dsk" option on C90)
**                 then read initial distribution function
**                 in from file "fpld_dsk" according to format
**                 given in source file finit.f.
**                 (Only works for  No additional preloading).
**      fpld(1,1)= -2.0   (Previously "fpld_ds1" option on C90)
**                then add additional loading with distribution
**                given in file "fpld_dsk", and renormalized to have
**                a fraction of the total (reden-)density 
**                as specified in fpld(2,1). Windowing of distribution is
**                given by fpld(7:10,k), as described below.
**      fpld(2,1)=in the case fpld(1,1)=-2.0, gives fraction
**                of additional loading which is in the distribution
**                specified by the "fpld_dsk" file.
**      For fpld(1,1)=real number.gt.0., (.ne.-1.0 or -2.0):
**      fpld(1,k)=fraction of flux surface averaged density of species
**                k which is in the additional preloading. (.ge.0., .le.1.)
**                (default=0.)   
**      fpld(2,k)=fraction of the additional loading which is in the
**                the shifted "Maxwellian".  (.ge.0., .le.1.)
**                (default =0.)
**      fpld(3,k)=Energy of peak of shifted "Maxwellian". (keV)
**      fpld(4,k)=Energy spread of distn. (keV).
**      fpld(5,k)=Pitch angle of peak of shifted "Max". (radians)

**      fpld(10,k)=Maximum pitch angle(radians) of loading function (def. pi)
**          N.B.  If using Zeff (as above) increases the number of
**                ion species, must give any desired additional
**                preloading through the appropriate fpld(k,...)

**
**  TIME-DEPENDENT PROFILES
**
***************************************************************
**
**  Time-dependent profiles are implemented either by specifying
**    (A) central and edge values for parabolic-type profiles
**    as a function of time, or as (B) a series of spline
**    profiles as described at time-dependent splines, below.
**
**  (A) central and edge values for parabolic-type profiles
**  =======================================================
**    nbctime > 0, and profile designator (iprone, etc.) is "prbola-t"
**    The exponents of the profiles are fixed in time,
**    and are those used elsewhere in the code.
**
**    BH131029:  Presently, it does not appear their is backward
**               compatability with iprone='parabola', nbctime.gt.0.
**               Need to fix this.
**    
**  Two methods are implemented for specification of the time-
**    dependent parabolic profiles, according to tmdmeth="method1"
**    or "method2".
**  tmdmeth="method1", then specify central and edge values at a
**            sequence of times, bctime(1:nbctime), as given below.
**         ="method2"  give central and edge values at only
**            two times bctime(1:2).  The edge and central
**            values are constant up to bctime(1), vary as
**            y=y2+((y1-y2)/2.)*(1.+cos((t-t1)/(t2-t1)) up to 
**            time bctime(2), and then constant.  y1 and y2
**            are given by redenc(1:2), and so on.
**            (default="method1")
**
**  nbctime=number of times at which profile data given.
**     Set nbctime=0 for no time-dependent profiles, else
**     specify time dependent profiles.  (default=0)
**  bctime(1:nbctime)=times at which data given (seconds).
**    (default= 0, 1., 2., ..., float(nbctimea-1))
**    If code time .lt. bctime(1), use bctime(1) profiles.
**    If code time .gt. bctime(nbctime), use bctime(nbctime) profiles.
**
**  Setting central values =0. at the first time step
**    turns off profile generation through this namelist variable.
**    (default is all central and edge values =0.)
**    BH131029:  Looking over profiles.f, this option does not appear
**               to be implemented.
**
**  redenc(1:nbctime,k), redenb(1:nbctime,k) central and edge values
**    for each species k (cm**-3).  The powers of the parabola are
**    given by npwr(0), mpwr(0) as above, and are time-independent.
**    NOTE: for time-dependent density profiles, most sensible cases will
**        use lbdry="scale". 
**    With time dependent density and lbdry="scale", density is added
**      to achieve specified density, at either the local (in time and
**      position) temperature, or at the input value of
**      temperature as specified by temp_den.
**  temp_den=0., use local in time and radius temperature for added density.
**           .ne.0., then use this as temperature of added density (keV).
**           (default= 0.0).
**  tempc(1:nbctime,k), tempb(1:nbctime,k) central and edge values
**    for each species k (keV).  npwr(1:ntotal), mpwr(1:ntotal ) 
**    as for temp( ,k).
**  zeffc(1:nbctime),zeffb(1:nbctime), with npwrzeff,mpwrzeff,
**    specify zeff profiles as described above.
**  NOTE: if using this option (i.e., zeffc(1).ne.0.), need to have 
**        iprozeff="prbola-t"  (see iprozeff above).
**        Also, can specify two maxwellian ion species,  one
**        with high enough Z, or the code will will add a second
**        ion species with Z=50.
**  elecc(1:nbctime),elecb(1:nbctime), with npwrelec(real),mpwrelec(real)
**    specify electric field profiles, unless current profile
**    control is enabled (volts/cm).  See below, D.C. ELECTRIC FIELD TERM.
**  vphic,vphib,npwrvphi,mpwrvphi similarly, specify toroidal rot (cm/sec).
**
**  Parallel Current profile (rather than specified electric field) gives
**    electric field if efswtch.eq."method2" or "method4", and
**    (xjc(1).ne.0., or totcrt.ne.0.):
**  xjc(1:nbctime),xjb(1:nbctime),npwrxj(real),mpwrxj(real) specify 
**    target current density profiles.  
**    If the following totcrt=0., but xjc(1).ne.0., 
**    then these profiles are absolute (amps/cm**2).  
**    If totcrt(1).ne.0, then these give the current density profile,
**      normalized to totcrt total plasma current. 
**  totcrt(1:nbctime) .ne.0., then total plasma current is specified
**    (amps) according to a profile given by xjc,xjb,npwrxj,mpwrxj.
**  NOTE: if using this option (i.e., xjc(1).ne.0.), need to have 
**        iprocur="prbola-t" (default = 'disabled').
**
**  (B) a series of spline profiles
**  ===============================
**  nbctime > 0, and the respective profile indicators (iprone, etc)
**    must be set to "spline-t", as appropriate.
**    Must have tmdmeth="method1".  Not set up for above "method2" case.
**    A series of radial profiles specified at the ryain(1:nprone)
**    are given corresponding to times bctime(1:nbctime).
**    Default values for the *_t inputs below are 0.0d0.
**  enein_t(1:njene,1:ntotal,1:nbctime) input as series of density
**    profiles.   If using iprozeff = "prbola-t" or "spline-t", densities
**    are set up as described with iprozeff and izeff namelist input.
**    Can scale profiles with enescal.
**    If time-dependent spline ion densities, assume 1st in species,
**    at least.
**  tein_t(1:njene,1:nbctime) input as series of Te profiles (keV).
**    Can scale profiles with tescal.
**  tiin_t(1:njene,1:nbctime) input as series of Ti profiles (keV).
**    Applies to all ion temperatures, although coding can be readily
**    adjusted for individual species if needed.
**    Can scale profiles with tiscal.
**  zeffin_t(1:njene,1:nbctime) input as series of Ti profiles (keV).
**     Used if iprozeff.eq."spline-t".
**  vphiplin_t  (1:njene,1:nbctime) input as series of toroidal
**     rotation profiles (cm/sec).
**  elecin_t(1:njene,1:nbctime) input as series of Tor. E-field
**     profiles (keV) unless current profile control is enabled (volts/cm).
**     See efswtch="method1".
**  ennin_t(1:njenea,1:nbctimea,1:npaproca)  input as a series of
**     neutral density profiles (cm^-3), impurities, etc.
**     Used if ipronn='spline-t'.
**     This array can be used for calculations of ion losses due to 
**     Charge-eXchange with neutrals (loss_cx="enabled" ; 
**     So far, works for fow='hybrid' or fow='full'). 
**     Also can be used for NPA diagnostics (npa_diag.ne."disabled"). 
**     Can be scaled with ennscal.
**     First index is the radial grid index, second is time-points index
**     (use  nbctime=1 and bctime(1)=0.0  for a steady-state profile).
**     Third index corresponds to type of CX (up to npaproc=5 for NPA,
**     and up to ntype_cx=1 for the ion loss model, see "loss_cx").
**     The values of ennin_t can be specified in cqlinput, 
**     or can be read from data file. To do this, specify in cqlinput:
**       read_ennprofile_times='enabled',
**       nennprofile_files= [specify number of data files to be read]
**       Also, for the array ennprofile_files(1:nennprofile_files), 
**       specify names of data files. 
**       The files should be in text form, with 1st and 2nd line
**       being headings containing description of data,
**       followed by two columns with data: 1st column is rho_sqpolflx
**       and 2nd column is profile of neutral density [cm^-3].
**       The data is read and processed by 
**       subroutine read_convert(filename,a_new): 
**       1. Read data from files containing rho-coordinate and profile 
**       of neutral density (or other profile, in general/future devel).
**       The name of the file is given by the input 'filename'.
**       The files should be in text form, with 1st and 2nd line
**       being headings containing description of data,
**       followed by two columns with data: 1st column is rho_sqpolflx
**       and 2nd column is profile of neutral density [cm^-3] 
**       (or other profile, in general/future development).
**       2. Convert the rho_sqpolflx coordinate from file into "working"
**       rho_radcoord coordinate, which type is specified by radcoord.
**       The size of rho_radcoord is same as that of rho_sqpolflx.
**       3. Interpolate rho_radcoord into rho_new of size=njene
**       and also interpolate original density profile  
**       into the new profile a_new of size=njene.
**       The array a_new(njene) is the output of subroutine. 
**       It will be put into array (for each time index itme):
**       ennin_t(1:njene,itme,1)= a_new(1:njene)  
**       The last index (=1) is for neutrals (H or D). 
**       Higher indices (2,3,4,5) will be used for setting profiles of
**       other neutrals or impurities (not ready as of May, 2013). 
**
**
**  Parallel Current profile (rather than specified electric field) gives
**    electric field if efswtch.eq."method2" or "method4", and
**    (xjin_t(1).ne.0., or totcrt.ne.0.):
**  xjin_t(1:njene,1:nbctime) specifies target current density profiles.
**    If the following totcrt=0., but xjin_t(1).ne.0., 
**    then these profiles are absolute (amps/cm**2).  
**    If totcrt(1).ne.0, then these give the current density profile,
**      normalized to totcrt total plasma current. 
**  totcrt(1:nbctime) .ne.0., then total plasma current is specified (amps)
**    according to a profile given by xjc,xjb,npwrxj,mpwrxj, or xjin_t.
**  NOTE: if using this option (i.e., xjc(1).ne.0.), need to have 
**        iprocur="spline-t"  (default='disabled').

**************************************************************
**
**  COLLISIONAL INPUT
**
***************************************************************
**
**  ncoef is the frequency of computation of collisional coefficients.
**    We use "n" as a time step (or cycle) designator.
**    If mod(n,ncoef)=1 or n=1, then compute the coefficients.
**    default: ncoef=1
**
**  mx is the highest order polynomial used in
**    Legendre expansion of distribution and potentials for
**    purposes of computing the collisional coefficients.
**    default: mx=3 (in aindflt.f)
**
**  colmodl selects the collision model:
**  ===> NOTE:  The default value is colmodl=1 <===
**              Be careful to specify the value you want in cqlinput:
**              colmodl=3 is the common setting.
**  colmodl=0 means fully nonlinear collisional coefficients (general
**    species and background species included).  Applied power gives
**    continual energy growth (in absence of nonlinear losses).
**  colmodl=1 means only contributions from background included
**    in the Fokker Planck collision term.
**  colmodl=2 means only contributions from the general species are
**    included (background ignored).
**  colmodl=3 is like colmodl=0 but the p0 component (0'th order
**    Legendre polynomial) from the general species is ignored.
**    Instead, a background Maxwellian of the same species is set up
**    at a fixed density and temperature which effectively
**    supplies the p0 component for the general species. The effect
**    of this "standard" treatment is that momentum and particles
**    are conserved by the like-particle collision operator, but
**    the background Maxwellian of specified density and temperature
**    act like a heat sink, and stabilizes the Fokker-Planck'd 
**    distribution against thermal runaway.
**        This option (colmodl=3) can be useful for runaway electron 
**    and resistivity calculations.  Unlike the colmodl=0 case, 
**    which would keeps accurate track of momentum
**    transfer but would allow the distribution to run away in a tau_e
**    time or so, this option would keep the bulk at the background
**    electron temperature, but still calculate momentum transfer
**    accurately. 
**        Use of colmodl=1 keeps the bulk from running away but
**    the momentum computed from the solution f will be wrong. 
**    colmodl=1 is the technique employed in the past by many codes
**    to compute DC electric field driven electron runaway rates.
**        Clearly, the colmodl=3 option is a kluge, and it does not
**    guarantee a positive definite operator. Thus if the bulk stays
**    cold but the distribution tail gets excited, the p1 component
**    might dominate the p0 component, and the velocity diffusion
**    coefficient cbl could become negative. Caveat emptor!
**        Note that the p0 component referred to above applies
**    to the contribution from a Maxwellian species at a fixed
**    temperature of the same type. For electron runaway calculations
**    one would have both general species electrons and background
**    electrons. The colmodl=3 option would "see" the contribution
**    from the background electrons as the p0'th component and the
**    other components would come from the general species electrons.
**  colmodl=4.....(undocumented and unsupported option)
**    default: colmodl=1
**
**  kfield(k)="enabled" means that species "k" is included as a field
**    species in the calculation of the collision integral coefficients.
**    kfield(k)="disabled" means it is excluded.
**    default: kfield(k)="enabled"
**
**  gamaset .ne. 0. means that all Coulomb logarithms are set to
**    gamaset. gamaset = 0. means that the log is computed internally.
**    default: gamaset=0. **However, need to use gamaset.ne.0 for ions.
**                        **This needs attention.
**
**  gamafac = "enabled", then for electrons as (only) general species, 
**    multiply the Coulomb logrithms (e-e and e-i) in the
**    collision FP coefficients by and energy dependence as follows:
**     The energy dependent Coulomb log will be
**       alog(flamcql + min(sqrt(gamma-1),1)*(flamrp-flamcql)),
**       where flamcql is the argument of cql e-e Coulomb log,
**       and flamrp is the argument of the Rosenbluth-Putvinski
**       (Nucl. Fus. 1997) high energy electron Coulomb log.
**       The sqrt(gamma-1)-factor is chosen in accord with
**       the energy factor in the the CQL Coulomb log
**       (cf., Killeen et al. book.  The CQL Coulomb log
**       reduces to the NRL, Te.gt.10eV expression).  
**       This factor become significant at electron energies 
**       of order of greater than me*c**2.
**
**  qsineut = "enabled" or "maxwel" forces background electron density to
**    evolve to maintain quasi-neutrality in time. The midplane line
**    density of the electrons will equal the sum of the midplane line
**    densities of all the ionic species for qsineut="enabled".
**    For qsineut="maxwel" the sum is over background ions only.
**    Note that this option will not
**    apply if general species electrons are present. Use of this option
**    precludes use of locquas="enabled" below.
**    default: qsinuet="disabled"
**
**  locquas="enabled" means that if (1) electrons are not a general species
**    and (2) if qsineut="disabled" (above) then the background electrons are
**    not treated exactly as Maxwellians for purposes of computing their
**    contribution to the collision integral. Rather, they are assumed
**    to be local Maxwellians (at z along the orbit) with a density that
**    maintains local quasineutrality at z with all the ionic
**    species. A true Maxwellian is constant in density as a
**    function of z.
**    If locquas="disabled", this option does not apply.
**    default: "disabled"
**
**  trapmod="enabled", modifies the magnetic well on each flux surface
**    by transforming B/B_min ==>    B/B_min - trapredc*(B/B_min-1.),
**    where B is the magnetic field as a function of poloidal angle,
**    B_min is the minimum value on the flux surface.
**  trapredc is the fraction by which the magnetic well is reduced.
**    Thus, trapredc=0. gives no reduction.
**    trapredc=1. gives complete reduction, i.e., constant B (no well).
**    This option is to help in a heuristic evaluation of the
**    effect of trapping.
**    Have had problems with the theta mesh for trapredc.gt.0.99
**                                       (BobH, 981018). 
**    default: trapmod="disabled"
**  trapredc= fractional reduction in magnetic well on each flux surface.
**    default: trapredc=0.
**
**  scatmod="enabled" modifies the collisional "pitch angle scattering"
**    F coefficient, according to scatfrac, below. 
**    Setting mx=0 gives zero value to the 
**    collisional C, D, and E coefficients (the Rosenbluth g and h
**    functions become independent of pitch angle).  F is the only
**    remaining coefficient of a pitch angle derivative term.
**    F is multiplied by scatfrac, thus scatfrac=0. shuts off
**    the collisional scattering.
**    (default: scatmod="disabled").
**  scatfrac= multiplier of collisional F coeff.
**    (default: scatfrac=1.  Also, reset to 1. if scatmod.eq."disabled:).

**
** ENERGY AND PARTICLE (KROOK) LOSSES
**
********************************************************************
**
**  There are three classes of particle and/or energy losses, set
**    by (1)lossmode(k), (2) torloss(k), and (3) tauegy().gt.0.:
**
**  (1)Several models are available and are invoked by setting
**  lossmode(k) to the chosen "string" in the input:
**  "snk0"==>  orbits whose energy is less than that corresponding
**    to normalized velocity x=xsink (namelist input) are loss 
**    orbits and are lost from the system with characteristic time equal to
**    the bounce time.
**  esink/xsink are alternate means for setting a loss boundary.
**    If esink.ne.0., then this energy (keV) specifies the boundary.
**    Else, use xsink (normalized velocity to vnorm). Used in cases 
**    lossmode(k)=snk0 and mirrsnk1.
**  "snk0accl"==>same as "snk0" except the loss mechanism is acceler-
**    ated by factor xsinkm (input).
**  "electron"==> forces a loss cone for general species electrons only
**    if the parallel energy is greater than eparc(k,l_) or the 
**    perpendicular energy is greater than eperc(k,l_).
**  "mirrorcc"==>potential square well model for tandem mirror central
**    cell calculations; orbits passing through a potential jump
**    at the throat of magnitude ephicc (namelist, below) are lost.
**  "mirrsnk"==> means both mirrorcc and snk0 options are used.
**  "mirrsnk1"==>means a loss cone as for mirrorcc, except
**     particles with velocity less than esink/xsink are not lost.
**    default: lossmode(k)="disabled"
**  "simplban"==> then trapped general species ions (or electrons) with

**  simpbfac=factor times radius of LCFS, modifying loss radius at
**    which particles are scraped off, for "simplban" losses.
**    For example, 1.05 increases the radius by 5%.  (The physical 
**    distance will depend somewhat on the value of radcoord.)
**    default: simpbfct=1.0
**  "frm_file"==> then read lossfile, specified as below.
**     [future options could be "file1",  etc. for different formats].
**  default: lossmode(k)="disabled"
**
**  lossfile(k) for lossmode(k)="frm_file", gives the
**    character*512 ascii path to a file specifying
**    region of prompt particle loss (integer 0 as function of
**    u_par,u_perp).  See file format in subroutine losscone.
**    The file gives loss-regions versus upar-uperp on a radial set
**    of flux surfaces (presently to be same as cql3d rya(1:lrz) grid).
**    Max velocity (vc_cgs) for u_par (=max(u_perp)) is specified 
**    in the file and may be different than given by enorm (for cql3d).
**    If vc_cgs.lt.vnorm, then loss regions at vc_cgs are extended
**    to vnorm at constant pitch angle.
**    Except, if data is given on twice as many flux surfaces as
**    specified by lrz, then the data set is reduced by omitting
**    data for every second flux surface.
**    default: "./prompt_loss.txt"
**
**  eparc(k,) and eperc(k,): see lossmode="electron" above.
**   They are set in the same manner as reden is set, by specifying
**   eparc(0,k) and if lrz.gt.1 eparc(1,k) also.  Similarly, eperc.
**
** (2)The torloss(k) series provides an loss term -f/taulos,
**    treated implicitly.
**  nonloss, and noffloss give time steps for start and stop
**      of these loss terms.  (defaults: nonloss=0, noffloss=10000).
**    torloss(k)="velocity" provides for an additional toroidal loss 
**    term, and the toroidal loss time will be determined by an 
**    ad hoc formula determined from input values tauloss(1-3,k):
**    tloss=tauloss(1,k)*(1.+tauloss(2,k)*(v(j))**tauloss(3,k))
**    where v(j) is the j'th velocity (momentum/mass) mesh point.
**    v(j)=x(j)*vnorm, x(j) code variable.
** tauloss(1:3,k)  loss rate coefficients (default=0.)
** torloss(k) = "flutter" gives a model similar to "velocity", but
**    dividing rather than multiplying the x part, to be able to model
**    Rechester-Rosenbluth type loss (with tauloss(3,k)=1):
**    tau = tauloss(1,k)/(1 + tauloss(2,k)*(x*vnorm)**tauloss(3,k))
**    Losses only applied to transiting particles for the "flutterx"
**        model.
** torloss(k) = "flutter1", further multiply tau(flutter) by gamma**5.
** torloss(k) = "flutter2", loss time tau is modelled on
**    electron diffusion in a stochastic magnetic field of
**    strength deltabdb, defined below.
**    The loss time is 
**       tau= (distance from plasma edge)**2/(4*v_par*D_st),
**       D_st= the magnetic field diffusion coefficient,
**           =pi*R_eff*deltabdb**2
**       1/R_eff = 1/(pi*q_safety*R_mag) + 1/lambda_mfp
** torloss(k) = "flutter3", further multiply tau(flutter2) by gamma**5.
** deltabdb=the perpendicular fluctuating B field amplitude 
**    divided by the ambient B-field.
** torloss(k)="energy" means all particles with energy less than
**    enloss(k) (Kev) will have a loss time of tauloss(1,1)
** torloss(k)="relativ" means the loss time goes like
**   tauloss(1,k)*gamma**3
** torloss(k)="shell" is like "energy" above, but with the additional
**    effect that all particles with an energy greater than
**    .9*enorm are also lost.
** torloss(k)= "disabled" disables this option.
**    default: torloss(k)="disabled"
** enloss(k)=See torloss(k)="energy" above.
**
** (3)tauegy(k=1,ngen,0:1) .gt. 0.0 gives energy loss profiles, 
**    according to bounce average of the phenomonological 
**    energy loss term:
**            df/dt = v**-2*d/dv[1./tau(v,theta,lr_)*v**3*f/2.]
**    where   tau is energy loss time specified by
**            tau=rfact*tauegy*gamma**gamegy, v.le.vte
**                rfact*tauegy*gamma**gamegy/
**                (abs(v_par,lr_)/vte)**paregy*(v_per/vte)**peregy
**                            *(v/vte)**pegy),  v.gt.vte
**            rfact is a radially dependent modifier, as below.
**    tauegy(k,0), tauegy(k,1) are expanded out across lrzmax flux surfaces
**      parabolically, according to
**         (tauegy(k,0)-tauegy(k,1))*(1-(rho/a)**negy(k))**megy(k)+tauegy(k,1)
**  negy(1:ngen), megy(1:ngen), as above.
**  gamegy(1:ngen), paregy(1:ngen), peregy(1:ngen), pegy(1:ngen), as above.
**
**
**
**  Also have possibility of synchrotron and bremsstrahlung reaction
**    force on the electrons:
**
**  syncrad="gyro" gives synchrotron radiation energy loss
**            force on electrons according to formula of 
**            Bernstein and Baxter, Phys. Fl. Vol. 24, p. 108 (1981).
**          "geom" gives synchrotron radiation energy loss
**            force on electrons according to formula of
**            derived (BobH+Paul Parks) to account for accelerations
**            due to toroidal and poloidal following of field lines.
**          "gyrogeom" gives both "gyro" and "geom" effects.
**          (default: "disabled")
**
**  bremsrad="enabled" gives bremsstrahlung radiation energy loss 
**           force on the electrons. (combined with above phenomenological
**           energy losses).  (default:"disabled")
**           Reference: Physics Vade Mecum, H.L.Anderson, Ed. Sec. 16.07.F.
**           brfac,brfac1,brfacgm3 are additional factors which control
**           onset of an ad hoc high enhanced Bremsstrahlung which is
**           used to "catch" runaway electrons before they go off the

**  D.C. ELECTRIC FIELD TERM
**
**********************************************************************
**
**  efswtch is a switch for the method for specifying the toroidal
**    electric field:
**    ="method1" ==> direct specification of the electric field
**                   by elecfld, eoved, or time-independent 
**                   elecin (with iproelec="spline"),or time-dependent
**                   profiles (with iproelec="prbola-t" or "spline-t"),
**                   elecc, elecb, npwrelec, mpwrelec. (default)
**    ="method2" ==> Direct (Method1) used for efield up until
**                   time step noncntrl.
**                   Then relax electric field so current converges towards
**                   specified time-dependent values of flux surface
**                   averaged parallel current (xjc,xjb,
**                   npwrxj,mpwrxj,totcrt).
**    ="method3" ==> Direct (Method1) used for efield up until 
**                   time step noncntrl
**                   Then relax electric field so current tends towards
**                   current obtained with specified elec. field up
**                   to the time step noncntrl.
**    ="method4" ==> relax electric field so current converges towards
**                   specified time-dependent values of parallel current
**                    (xjc,xjb,npwrxj,mpwrxj,totcrt).  (I.E. as in "method2").
**                   Initial electric field determined through spitzer
**                   conductivity.
**                   Presently setting this up for specified radial
**                   profile of parallel current at min B point.
**                   Could add specification of toroidal or poloidal
**                   current fairly easily (BH, 020227).
**    ="method5" ==> relax electric field so current converges towards
**                   EQDSK specified parallel current (mu_0*J_parallel=
**                   mu_0*R*(B_phi/|B|)*dp/dpsi+|B|*dF/dpsi).
**                   J_parallel is given the sign of I_plasma in the EQDSK.
**                   Initial electric field determined through spitzer
**                   conductivity. Should also set efflag="parallel";
**                   otherwise could have problems if B_phi changes
**                   sign as in an RFP.
**                   (Needs eqmod="enabled". Code checked for
**                   eqsource="eqdsk" setting, but not others.)
**
**  efswtchn="neo_hh" is switch to turn on an alternative calculation
**    of plasma current density from the code, to be used with above
**    convergence to prescribed values according to method2==>method5 
**    The calc'd current density, to be compared with the target
**    current density,  will be the sum of Hinton and Haseltine 
**    neoclassical contribution  (eta_neoclassical*elecfld) and runaway 
**    current from the electron distribution.
**    This option is provided in order to more accurately calculated current
**    in higher collisionality cases (such as in the cold plasma after
**    pellet injection or after disruption) in which the thermal particles
**    may be collisional but the tail electrons remain in the low-
**    collisionality banana regime.
**    (default="disabled").
**
**  curr_edge=An linear wedge of current varying from 0. at r/a=0.8
**            to curr_edge at r/a=1.0, which may be added to the
**            eqdsk obtained current density (efswtch="method5").
**            This is parallel current density at the min B flux surface pt.
**            Units are Amps/cm**2.  Default: curr_edge=0.
**            Might be useful for transport runs. 
**    
**  efiter="enabled" gives up to nefitera (a code parameter,  
**            presently 10) iterations for the electric field used 
**            AT EACH TIME STEP,  to achieve the target current within 
**            fractional accuracy currerr (nml below).  For
**            each iteration, the electric field is reset to
**            a new value according to the efrelax1, and
**            the Fokker-Planck equation for the time step is
**            re-solved.  "enabled" doesn't make sense for 
**            efswtch="method1".   (default="enabled".)

**                     target current density). 
**            (See efield.f file).

**
**  elecfld(l_) is the (Ohmic) electric field (volts/cm) vs flux surface
**              for machine="toroidal". Electric field values
**              are evaluated on each flux surface at the major radius
**              of the magnetic axis, and field varies on a flux
**              surface like 1/R.  That is E(R,Z)=elecfld(l_)*Rmag/R.
**    See input variable reden for lrz=1 and lrz > 1 cases.

**
**  npwrelec,mpwrelec are parameters of parabolic electric field with

**
**  eoved is the value of E/E-Dreicer. If eoved .le. 0 then the

**    in general. Works for lrz .ge. 1.   If .gt.1, should use .ge.4,
**    since density/temperature are splined.
**    default:eoved=-.01
**    If lbdry(kelec).eq."fixed" and eoved.gt.0, then elecfld
**      is set through eoved only at time step n=0.  This avoids
**      variation of elecfld due to variation of E-Dreicer as
**      the electron density changes.
**    E-Driecer = m_e nu_0 v_Te / (2*charge), v_Te=sqrt(T_e/m_e),
**     nu_0 = 4 pi n_e charge**4 ln(lambda)/(m_e**2 v_Te**3)

**  The code is not presently set up for non-up/down-symmetric equilibria.

**
**  eqsym= Specifies the manner of up/down symmetrization.
**          "none", to be used for no-symmetrization, 
**                  when it becomes available (BH:Oct'09).
**                  Only valid for eqmod.eq."enabled",eqsource="eqdsk".
**                  Must have taunew='enabled'.
**                  Note:  Still require in eqdsk that ymideqd, up-down 
**                         mid-point of the z-mesh, is equal to 0.
**          "average", up-down-symmetrization by averaging psi-values
**             above and below z=0 plane. 
**             (Only possibility until June,'02).
**          "avg_zmag", up-down-symmetrization by averaging psi-values
**             above and below z=zmag plane.  zmag is given in the
**             equilibrium data, the z-value of the magnetic axis.
**             Then vertically shift data so zmag is zero, and similarly
**             adjust RF and diagnostics (X-ray) and NBI source.
**          "top", up-down-symmetrization by reflecting psi in the plane
**             above zmag to z.lt.zmag.  Then vertically shift 
**             data so zmag is zero, and similarly
**             adjust RF and diagnostics (X-ray) and NBI source. 
**          "bottom", up-down-symmetrization by reflecting psi in the 
**             plane below zmag to z.gt.zmag.  Then vertically shift 
**             data so zmag is zero, and similarly
**             adjust RF and diagnostics (X-ray) and NBI source.
**       default: eqsym="average" 
**
**  eqsource controls the equilibrium disk file source
**  eqsource="eqdsk" indicates an eqdsk file is to be read in. An eqdsk
**    file is a standard equilibrium code output file. See, for instance,
**    GA Tech report GA-A18036 by Helton and Bernard. Input variables
**    rboxdst rbox zbox radmaj radmin bth and btor are reset from eqdsk
**    data. This file, which must reside on the user's disk space, is
**    named eqdsk by default but can be reset using eqdskin below.
**  eqsource="topeol"  indicates the existence of a disk file called
**    topeol which is the output from a Culham equilibrium code. This
**    is not a standard choice for eqsource.
**  eqsource="ellipse"  while eqmod="enabled" generates elliptical cross-
**    section flux surfaces; this option requires, in addition, that
**    that input variables ellptcty, eqmodel, eqpower, fpsimodl, and rmag
**    be set. The limiter position is assumed to be located at (R,Z)=
**    (rmag,radmin). radmin is the minor radius.
**    This is a fragile option, used only for the original debug
**    and is not recommended for use in general.
**    default: eqsource="eqdsk"
**  eqsource="tsc" implies that the code will utilize a file generated
**    by the Princeton (S. Jardin) TSC transport code...this file
**    provides more than magnetic geometry information. Density and
**    temperature profiles for species are also provided by this
**    file. This file is called 'tscinp'. (Must have lrzmax.gt.1).
**
**  eqdskin= character*512 name of input eqdsk file.  Default="eqdsk".
**
**  bsign=Multiplier of toroidal B-field terms read from eqdsk(btor,f,ff'),
**    and of the total B-field plus sign of npar in URFREAD_ input files.  
**    This is a  fix of neg. B-field problems in the URF routine
**    and possible elsewhere.  See urfread_.f (BobH, 980611). 
**    This is only for eqsource="eqdsk", btor.lt.0.  (default: bsign=1.0)
**
**  eqdskalt="enabled" means that once the current is computed
**    it is utilized to compute p' and ff'. These quantities are
**    then used to update the "eqdsk" file if eqmod="eqdsk".
**    eqdskalt="disabled"
**
**  povdelp determines the flux surface at which the calculation
**    takes place if rovera < 0. The value of psi (poloidal flux
**    coordinate) chosen is psi=psimag-(psimag-psilim)*povdelp.
**    psimag is psi at the magnetic axis; psilim is psi at the limiter.
**    In this code psimag.gt.psilim.
**    0. .le. povdelp .le. 1.
**    default:povdelp=.2
**
**  ellptcty is the ellipticity of the contours for eqsource="ellipse".
**    =0 gives circles.
**    ---> 1 give ellipses increasingly high in the Z direction.
**      default: =0
**
**  rmag gives the R position of the magnetic axis for eqsource="ellipse"
**    default: 100. (cm)
**
**  eqmodel chooses a model for the value of the poloidal flux function
**    on the flux surface generated by use of option eqsource="ellipse":
**    psi(R,Z)=factor*E**eqpower where
**    E=sqrt(Z**2+(R-rmag)**2/(1.-ellptcty**2)).
**    The factor is determined from the choice of bth.
**    default: eqmodel="power"
**    No other models currently exist (4/15/88).
**
**  eqpower is described just above.
**    default: eqpower=1.
**
**  fpsimodl="constant" means the f=R*btor is independent of psi.
**    This is the only model currently available for eqsource="ellipse".
**
**  rbox and zbox define the R length and the Z height of the
**    computational domain where the equilibrium is determined and
**    psi(R,Z) is defined.
**    It need be set only if eqsource="ellipse"
**    default:rbox=zbox=100
**
**  rboxdst is the value of R defining the inside edge of the box
**    They need be set only if eqsource="ellipse"
**    (above).
**    default: rboxdst=50.
**
**  atol and rtol are the absolute and relative accuracies demanded
**    of the LSODE orbit integrating routine.
**    A coupled pair of O.D.E's are solved to determine the
**    field line orbit.
**    default; both are 1.e-8
**
**  For the LSODE O.D.E. solver we specify:
**   methflag=10 for nonstiff Adams method (no Jacobian used).
**           =21 for stiff (BDF) method, user supplied Jacobian.
**               (Jacobian supplied in subroutine eqjac)
**           =22 for stiff method, internally generated Jacobian.
**    default:10
**
**  nconteqn(integer), and
**  nconteq(character*8)  play roles 
**    in interfacing between the input magnetic
**    configuration and the chosen flux surfaces where the 
**    fokker-plancking will take place. In order to select the flux
**    surface psi associated with a choice of rovera, an interpolation
**    is done with respect to an array of flux surface values eqpsi(l).
**    If nconteq.ne."psigrid", then
**    (integer) nconteqn .le. nconteqa generates an array 
**    eqpsi(l) evenly spaced in psi.
**  nconteq="psigrid" generates an array evenly spaced at R values in
**    the the midplane corresponding to the eqdsk from the magnetic
**    axis to the plasma edge.  The value of
**    nconteqn is calculated.  (For a 33x65 grid, a typical number
**    is found to be 12).
**    defaults: "psigrid" (highly recommended operating mode,
**                         although not sure why, BH990909),
**                        BH131001: NOT RECOMMENDED.  The
**                        nconteqn value generated by this method
**                        is roughly the number of R points in the
**                        eqdsk between the mag axis and psilim,
**                        which may be much too small for accurate
**                        binning in nfrey.  Rather I now suggest
**                        nconteq="disabled", nconteqn=40 or 50.
**               nconteqn=0
**
**  lfield should be .le. lfielda and is the number of poloidal
**    points at which the O.D.E. integrator returns values for
**    R(s) and Z(s), where s parameterizes the contour.
**    default: lfield=lfielda  and lfielda should be around 250.

**  rffile(1:mrf)=names of input netcdf files (e.g., from genray or toray)
**    Default values for up to first three of rffile(1:nmodsa)=
**    "rayech.nc","rayfw.nc","raylh.nc".
**    If rrfile(1)="mnemonic", then the value of the &setup0 namelist 
**                 variable mnemonic is used to generate the rffile() names:
**                 rffile(1)=mnemonic//"_rf.nc"  [//=concatenate sign]
**                       (2)=mnemonic//"_rf.1.nc"
**                       (3)=mnemonic//"_rf.2.nc"
**                       ETC.
**                 This option is designed so that ray data will be
**                 output into the same file as it is read in from.
**                 The output file will contain updated data, and
**                 file proliferation will be reduced.
**    If rffile(1)=any name other than "mnemonic", then that name is
**                 used for the netcdf input file.  Set the corresponding
**                 rffile(2:mrf) if .gt.1 wave types are used.
**                 [User has to ensure that data files correspond
**                  to the order of the enabled subset of the rffile()=
**                  ech,fw,lh namelist variables above; for example,
**                  if only fw and lh are enabled, rffile(1) would
**                  give fw data, rffile(2) would give lh data.]
**
**  Note:  it is possible to apply the identical ray data files to
**         separate plasma species (for ngen.ge.2 cases), by entering
**         the identical path specs for sucessive rffile() entries.
**         The code detects the files have identical path specs and
**         directs the wave interaction to be with specified species
**         as given below in corresponding nrfspecies(1:mrf).
**         Wave damping for this repeated rffile data is computed by
**         summing both over the specified harmonics and over the species.
**
**  nharms(i=1,mrf).gt.0, then for each ray type calculate damping 
**            for harmonics nharm1(i) to nharm1(i)+(nharms(i)-1),
**            rather than according to nharm in the ray data file.
**            This is preferred input method.  
**        =0, then use harmonic number given in raylh, rayech, 
**            or rayfw, etc., files. The number of harmonics will be 1.
**            This input method is depracated.
**
**  nharm1(i=1,mrf)=lowest harmonic in the series for each wave type
**                  (default=0).
**
**  nrfspecies(i=1,mrf)=general species which each wave type is
**                      applied to.  default: nrfspecies(1:nmodsa)=1
**
**  Following call_ech/call_lh/call_fw not presently fully implemented.
**    [BH060314].
**  call_lh="enabled" means that CQL3D will call and utilize the Brambilla
**    ray tracing code (xbr).  ="disabled" means that the ray tracing code
**    will not be called, but that CQL3D will still expect the presence
**    of a raylh file (output from Brambilla code)
**    default: call_lh="disabled"
**
**  call_ech="enabled", call and utilize Toray code (toray). 
**          ="disabled", then still may get data from rayech file.
**
**  call_fw="enabled", call and utilize Brambilla code (xbr) for
**    fast waves. (Since polarizations come from the ray data file
**    this option can also be used for lh.
**
**  pwrscale(1:mrf)=scale factor to be applied to the power entering
**    the plasma as given in the ray data files, applied to each of
**    wave types used.
**
**  Time-dependent scaling of power is achieved with an additional
**    multiplier of the pwrscale(1:mrf), above. This is implemented 
**    by specifying the array variable pwrscale1() at a sequence
**    of nurftime corresponding times, specified through in the 
**    variable urftime() (seconds).
**    Interpolation of pwrscale1 between time points is linear.   
**    If simulation time becomes greater than urftime(nurftime), 
**    then power scaling continues at the value pwrscale1(nurftime).
**    nurftime =0 gives no pwrscale1 scaling.
**    (nurftime must be .le. the parameter nbctimea, presently =101).
**
**    nurftime=0 is default.
**    pwrscale1(1:nbctimea) defaulted to 1.
**    urftime(1:nbctimea) defaulted to 0.
**
**
**  Setting central values =0. at the first time step
**    turns off profile generation through these namelist variable.
**    (default is all central and edge values =0.)
**
**
**  urfmult= multiplier of quasilinear diffusion coefficients
**           and damping calc in urf calcs.  (for test purposes).
**           default: urfmult=1.0
**
**  wdscale(1:nmodsa)=scale factor for n_parallel-width of rays,
**    applied to wdnpar, when read in from ray data file.
**
**  N.B.: Previous 2 variables, pwrscale and wdscale, will modify
**  ray data if it is output, as specified below by urfwrray="enabled". 
**
**  nbssltbl=the number of elements initially in the Bessel table.
**
**  nondamp= damping turned on in urf module, for n.ge.nondamp.
**           (The QL diffusion coeffs are calculated and used in the FP
**            equation, but the rays are not damped, until n.ge.nondamp.
**            This has been used for certain code diagnostic cases.)
**    Default: nondamp=0
**
**
**  The following namelist control variables are used to determine the
**    sequence of operations in the urf module:
**    nrfstep1, nrfstep2, nrfpwr, nrfitr1, nrfitr2, nrfitr3, urfncoef.
**    The purpose of these controls is to permit a "soft" turn-on
**    of the RF, avoiding formation of pathalogical distributions
**    during startup of the RF. In many situations, it is not
**    necessary to tune this process: just turn on full power.
**
**   nurf=A counter in the urf control subroutine urfchief,
**   nurf=the number of calls to urfchief which have resulted in
**        calculation or recalculation of the diffusion coefficients.
**        This variable will be incremented each time
**        n/integer(urfncoef*ncoef)*integer(urfncoef*ncoef).eq.n.
**        Generally, there is a solution of the FP eqn after each
**        call to urfchief.
**                                                  
**   The sequence of actions (as a function of 
**   increasing nurf.ge.0 at each call) is given by the following steps
**   (after each diffusion coeff calc, control returns to the calling
**    subroutine):
**   1. For nurf=0, calc or read ray data for nrfstep1 spatial steps 
**      along the ray.
**   2. Calc. damping of ray data, and then resulting quasilinear
**      diffusion coeffs, using a fraction of the input power
**      = (1/2)**nrfpwr.
**      return.
**   3. Repeat step 2 for next nrfpwr calls, but with fractional input
**      power (1/2)**(nrfpwr-1), (1/2)**(nrfpwr-2),.... (1/2)**0. 
**      (This step is a no-op if nrfpwr=0). 
**   4. Iterate step 2 with full input power for next nrfitr1 calls.
**      (This step is a no-op if nrfitr1=0). 
**   5. Extend extendable rays by nrfstep2 steps.
**   6. Re-calc damping from ray data and then quasilinear diffusion 
**      coeffs.  Iterate this step nrfitr2 additional calls.
**   7. Steps 5 and 6 are carried out nrfitr3 times. 
** 
**   Thus choose 
**        nstop= 
**        (nrfpwr+1+nrfitr1+nrfitr3*(nrfitr2+1))*integer[urfncoef*ncoef]
**   if the above sequence is to be completed.
**   Default values:  nrfstep1=100, nrfstep2=50
**                    nrfpowr=3
**                    nrfitr1=1, nrfitr2=1, nrfitr3=2
**                    urfncoef=1.0                             
**  
**
**  scaleurf="enabled" means rescale the contribution to urfb (the 
**      diffusion coefficient so that a particular ray does not 
**      "overdamp" on a  given flux surface volume. Note in the limit 
**      that the number of flux surfaces goes to infinity, 
**      overdamping would not happen. Here by invoking 
**      this option, we seek to override the possibility that
**      more power may be deposited by a ray than is actually in it,
**      due to the coarse grid. We recommend using this option.
**      default: scaleurf="enabled"
**
**  iurfcoll(1:mrf)="enabled" means add the collisional absorption of
**            the ray ....this information is passed in the ray data file
**            in variable salphac.
**       ="damp_out", then the damping coefficient along the ray 
**                    in the poloidal plane is written into the salphac
**                    (collisional absorption coeff) in the RF netcdf 
**                    file and (if urfwrray="enabled", 
**                    into the rayXXX ray data file).
**                    This is for code diagnostics (comparison of ray
**                    tracing damping coef with cql3d damping coeff).
**        NOTE:  In cases where the SAME wave is applied to
**               multiple general species (with nrfspecies, below),
**               usually will want this variable "enabled" only once.
**        default(1:mrf):"disabled"
**
**  iurfl(1:mrf)="enabled", means include the additional linear absorption
**                    from the ray data file [in ray data variable salphal]
**                    is added to the calculated damping or power
**                    flowing along the ray.  
**                    This may be used, for example, to add linear ion 
**                    damping calculated in the ray tracing code to 
**                    cql3d electron damping calculated in a cql3d
**                    electron simulation, or visa versa.
**        NOTE:  In cases where the SAME wave is applied to

**               usually will want this variable "enabled" only once.
**        default(1:mrf):"disabled"
**
**
**   ieqbrurf designates the source of equilibrium data to be used by xbr.
**       Appropriate values are: 
**       ieqbrulh=0, to use Brambilla analytic "equilibria",
**               =3, to use standard eqdsk input.
**               =4, to use extended eqdsk, including density, and
**                   temperature profiles,...
**       If eqsource="tsc", ieqbrulh is reset to = 4.
**
**  urfdmp="secondd" means utilize the "second derivative" damping
**      diagnostic in computing the damping due to each ray as
**      it moves through the plasma. If urfdmp .ne. "secondd" the 
**      diagnostic uses an integration by parts technique to compute
**      the damping. We highly recommend "secondd" because convergence
**      of the FP solution for distn F and the QL modification of F
**      is determined by agreement between the sum of the damping of 
**      all rays and the absorbed power as computed from dF/dt. This 
**      latter diagnostic utilizes the "second derivative" approach so
**      consistency demands "secondd" for the rays.
**        default:"secondd"
**
**      If ndeltarho='enabled' then "secondd" option not implemented,
**        only urfdmp='firstd', calculating damping including an 
**        integration by parts removing the 2nd derivative in the
**        calculation with (df/dt)_ql, is implemented.  In a test
**        case with ndeltarho='disabled', the urfdmp='firstd' and
**        'second' results were quite close [BH110617].

**  urfrstrt="enabled"  => "do not update delpwr" option
**     For convergence studies with previously calculated ray data files...

**     The Maxwellian values are used for n_e and T_e, unless

**     defaults: c1=1.0,c2=3.0,c3=3.0,c4=1.0,c5=-1.0,c6=0.0,c7=0.0
**               (Corresponding to previous nominal spatial profile.).
**     NOTE: 050921, appears previous radial dependence specification

**                   c1=1.0, c2=0.0 ,c[3-7]=arbitrary [BH].
**  difus_rshape(8) specifies additional drr radial shape which
**     is constant to normalized radius difus_rshape(8), then
**     decreases to zero as 0.5*(1.+cos(2*pi*rho/(0.1*difus_rshape(8)))).

**                 *(vprp/vth(k,l=1))**c3 /gamma**c4.

**
**  difin(ryain): Defines the radial diffusion profile using a set of
**     points at r=ryain in a similar way as tein, etc. 
**     If sum(abs(difin))>0, then this option is used instead 
**     of the profile from difus_rshape(1-7).
**     The difin profile is also multiplied by difusr.
**     The additional contribution from difus_rshape(8) is still added.
**     It is used in the file tdtrdfus.f.
**     It is useful since a good pragmatic definition is 
**     D(r) = D0 * chie(r), with chie profile from power balance
**     and D0~0.2 (as tested on TCV for example).
**  
**  pinch: specifies options available to maintain the density
**     profile in the presence of radial transport by a radial
**     pinch velocity.  Various cases correspond to whether
**     the radial diffusion term d_rr and/or the pinch
**     velocity d_r are velocity dependent.
**     A Newton-Raphson iteration for d_rr is available (soln_method
**     .ne.'it3drv') increasing the ability to maintain the density
**      profile for splitting method soln or radial transport eqns,
**     and is generally recommended.
**  pinch is only set up for ngen=1, at the present.  The target
**     density profile is the 1st Maxwellian species of electrons
**     or ions, depending on which species is being transported.
**     It is not difficult to extend it to multiple species.
**     Modifications in trtravct.f are required.
**     The specifics on pinch are:
**     
**  pinch="simple", velocity independent d_rr and d_r.
**        i.e., they depend only on plasma radius.
**        Non-cirular geometry effects are ignored.  
**        The pinch  velocity is computed to preserve the
**        initial density of the electron Maxwellian species
**        (but modified by advectr, as below).  
**        Relaxation or Newton-Raphson is not used.
**       ="case1", the advective coeff and the 
**        radial diffusion coeff are velocity independent.
**        Includes geometry+relaxation, not included in "simple".
**       ="case2", the advective coeff is indep of
**        velocity but the radial diffusion coeff can be
**        velocity dependent (as specified by difus_vshape).
**       ="case3",  we assume that the advective coeff has the same
**        velocity dependence as the radial diffusion coeff, i.e.,
**        d_r=adv(l)*d_rr. (d_rr vel shape specified by difus_vshape.)
**  "n" appended to the above options above (i.e., pinch=
**     "simplen", "case1n", or "case2n"), or, "case3n"
**     then,
**     the density is further maintained  by adjusting the radial
**     velocity at each time step using a Newton-Raphson interation
**     to obtain the velocity which keeps the density at the target,
**     i.e., at the initial density profile.
**     In general, the Newton techniques seems best, and adds
**     little computer time to the runs.
**    Default: pinch="disabled":  Radial advection term is 0. 
**      (May also work with multiple species, but  
**       hasn't been tried: BH020304)

**  This module can work for positive or negative ion based neutral
**  beams.  For negative ion beams, the full energy component is
**  generally very domoninant.   
**  For positive ion based NB sources such as TFTR, DIII-D, JET,
**  [quoting D.M. Thomas et al. (Rev. Sc. Instrum., 2012)]:
**  "As in all such arc discharge sources, the extracted positive ion 
**  current is distributed among the atomic and molecular ions D+, 
**  D_2+, D_3+, with additional small fractions due to such molecular 
**  ions as DO+, D_2 O+, and others. Subsequent collisions in a 
**  neutralizer cell ﬁlled with D_2 gas leads to the production of 
**  full, half, third, and other fractional energy components in the 
**  resulting neutral beam due to the various dissociation and charge
**  transfer processes.  While standard operation typically attempts
**  to maximize the full energy component, signiﬁcant half- and
**  third-energy components exist."

**  A new option, cqlpmod="enabled", has been introduced which in

**  keeping the variation along the magnetic field and thus without bounce

**  along the magnetic field line. In practice, one had only to change
**  the spatial dimension to be s instead of rho in the CQL3D case, and
**  to remove the bounce-averaging. This is why most of the arrays used
