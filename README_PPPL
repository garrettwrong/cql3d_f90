From Jin Chen, PPPL,  2014-07-31, for CQL3D compilation, along with
prepare and process files for interface with the Plasma State:  

Here are the makefile to compile prepare... and process... in intel and
pathf90 on portal.ppp.gov:

pathf90:
1. module load swim
2. cd /p/swim/jchen/IPS/ips/components/fp/cql3d/src.pathf90
    "make -f makefile_pathscale_portal_pppl PRE=0" compiles prepare...
    "make -f makefile_pathscale_portal_pppl PRE=1" compiles process...

ifort:
1. source /p/swim/jchen/IPS/ips/components/fp/cql3d/moduleload.intel
2. cd /p/swim/jchen/IPS/ips/components/fp/cql3d/src.intel
    "make -f makefile_intel_portal_pppl PRE=0" compiles prepare...
    "make -f makefile_intel_portal_pppl PRE=1" compiles process...

The source files for prepare... & process... are modified. Please do "svn
diff" to check.

In order to compile cql3d itself, please use

pathf90:
1. source /p/swim/jchen/IPS/genray/cql3d/intel-module_portal_pppl.csh
2. cd /p/swim/jchen/IPS/genray/cql3d/trunk
    "make -f ../makefile_intel_portal.pppl" to build a intel version

ifort:
1. source /p/swim/jchen/IPS/genray/cql3d/pathscale-module_portal_pppl.csh
2. cd /p/swim/jchen/IPS/genray/cql3d/trunk
    "make -f ../makefile_pathscale_portal_pppl" to build a pathf90 version

Please use "svn diff" to check the differences.
