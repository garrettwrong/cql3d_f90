c     This routine facilitates iteration to obtain a given current density.
c     Current is calculated.
c     If this current is not acceptably close to a target current,
c     the electric field is adjusted, and the distribution is reset
c     to the beginning of the time step, so that another trial can
c     be make.

c-YuP         go to 999

c     Set diagnostic variable elecn, on first iteration:

c     Calculate current (following subroutine diaggnde).
c     This is parallel current at minimum B point on a flux surface.

c     psifct=<(B/B_0)/R>/<1/R>, where B_0 is min mag fld of a flux surf,
c     <...> is flux surface volume average.

c     curr, is obtainted by multiplying parallel current at the 
c     midplane, currm, by psifct.  This gives the average j_parallel 
c     over the fixed-toroidal-angle cross-section area between
c     neighboring flux surfaces.  This approximates the same average of
c     the toroidal current, in the usual tokamak case.
c     curr is not an accurate physically meaningful quantity, 
c     and should be excised from the code. (BobH, 010301).
     
      curr(1,lr_)=currm(1,l_)*psifct
      currtp(lr_)=currtp(lr_)+curr(1,lr_)

c           Presently, the calculated parallel current
c           above is averaged over the area cross-section
c           (at cnst toroidal angle) between a flux surface.
c           This quantity is depracated, and should be replaced
c           in the future.  Here, for method5, we adjust currpar 
c           back to parallel current at the minimum B position.
c           See comments in eflditer.f, above, on psifct.

c     Compare fractional current error with allowable.
c     In necessary, set iteration flag, obtain new efield,
c        and adjust contribution of electric field coefficients.
