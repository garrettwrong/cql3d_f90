========================================================
Test of LH with iteration of DC electric field to obtain
eqdsk tor. current with no tranport, in
/home/bobh/cql3d/mst/100505_burke/MergedCQL3D_variant.1
==>  Looks sensible, although log file shows the electric
field iteration is not complete (but probably OK enough)
at lr_=14 (all other flux surfaces meet error criterion
currerr=0.1 by default).

=============================
Steffi Diem test case, with EBW (looks like), determining
electric field with 
 efswtch='method5'
 soln_method='it3drv'
Code runs after fixing couple of bounds errors (compiler
issue + diagnostic printing out-of-bounds).
But, electric field convergence is very slow.
Passed case to Yuri, to check out.
