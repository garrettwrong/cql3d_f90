Hello Paul,

I have recently send out copies of genray, xdraw, and cql3d to
several people: genray_distribution_121230.tar and
cql3d_121230.tar.

These files are about 4.5GB each, and include brief
descriptions, directions on compilation, and a 
set of regression tests.   I would propose sending
out this set to Lee and to Cheng Yang.   This way,
I will know exactly what they have, and they will know
where the code came from.

This version does not contain recent, in-progress
work on FOW.

There are others using genray and cql3d in China,
for example, W. Lu from Chengdu.   He is working with
Giruzzi and others to look at Girardo's claim of EC/LH synergy.
As I understand, Ron Prater has installed the code suite
at EAST.

Petrov has visited KSTAR in February, and installed this version of 
genray/cql3d, working with Sun-Ho Kim.

Jingchun Li, student at Univ. of South China, is using genray.
Alexander Kikushkin (Kurchatov) is working with genray/cql3d
to add a general radiation model.  Kikushkin is interested
in possible modification of radiation damping rates due to
quasilinear effects.

We ask that people who use the code and find any 
improvements will feed these back to me so they can
be carried forward in the general distribution.

We are, of course, delighted that genray/cql3d are being
found useful.

Thanks,

Bob

P.S.  Will need Lee and Cheng Yang emails.  We can resend
this email, with attachments.
