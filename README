NOTE:  Some variables in cqlinput_help refer to the finite orbit
version of the code, which is still being developed and is not
yet released (BH20151031).


To get an idea of most recent make files, do 
ls -lt make*
160602
======
c[263] version="cql3d_fullFOW_160508.2"
c[263] Upgraded lossmode(1)='simplban' so banana (+gyro) losses are based
c[263] on the first order deltarho orbit shift.  Kept the old pre-160403
c[263] model (='simplbn2'), and an intermediate model (='simplbn1') for
c[263] backward compatibility and cross-checking.  Main changes are in 
c[262] losscome.f.  [See file log.1_simplban_extended.gz for comparisons.]
c[262] Should use lossmode(1)='simplban' in combination with ndeltarho=
c[262] ='freya', to prevent unphysical scrapeoff of beams. [BH, 160602].
170107
======
Updating to version=cql3d_cswim_170101.1.
Reverted losscone.f to older version.  Also, urfb0.f and urfdamp1.f
reverted to older version of the rrr= resonance calculation.
Regression tests for D3D_96143_one_ray and 
D3D_ngen2_urf_NBI_H.short_rerun_161230 used to check out the code.
Also, ran a KSTAR EC test. Edc_full_eps ==> six fig agreement on current.



180425
======
Put cql3d_cswim_180101.1 under git version control.
